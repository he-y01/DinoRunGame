## This Project
This project was created as part of the course "Introduction to Unity" at the University of Osnabrück and is meant to be a 2.5 D game. 

Our idea is based on the well-known [Google Dinosaur Game](https://googledino.com/), which we wanted to recreate, extend and embed in a Unity surrounding. 


## Programs Used 
All the elements included in DinoRun were designed by us and no third-party images and assets were used. 

In order to design all the different elements and create the scripts, we used the following tools: 

### Organization
For organizational matters, to structure our project and for communication purposes, we used [Notion](https://www.notion.so/de-de). 

### Design
- 3D Pixel Art for the environment and player:  [MagicaVoxel](https://ephtracy.github.io/)
- 2D Pixel Art for the status and logo: [Pixilart](https://www.pixilart.com/)

### Programming
- IDE: [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/de/)
- Game engine: [Unity](https://unity.com/)
